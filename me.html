<h1 style="text-align: center;">Seth (Sith14)</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Hello, I'm Seth, but online I sometimes go by Sith14. 14 IS and ALWAYS WILL BE the BEST number. If you're wondering WHY I love 14 so much, <a href="https://secure.sith14.fun/skeppy">click here</a>. Anyways, I'm a non-binary and my pronouns are she/they. My real name isn't actually Seth, but I'm working on legally changing it :D! I am a BIG Apple fan. I don't own many Apple products, but currently I have AirPods &amp; an iPhone. I love plushies. Especially if its from a cartoon or video game I like! I have 1 Huggy Wuggy plushie from the horro game <a href="https://secure.sith14.fun/poppy">Poppy Playtime</a>, and I have a few <a href="https://secure.sith14.fun/mario">Super Mario</a> plushies. And as much I'm an Apple fan, I'm a Nintendo fan! If you wonder why I love Nintendo AND Apple so much, <a href="https://secure.sith14.fun/plainrock124">click here</a>.</h2>
