<p style="text-align: center;">Juste... honey. This is the paragraph you've been waiting for. I am such in love with you. I literally cannot stand EVEN A DAY without texting you. You are my whole life. My life honestly revolves around you. When you become mad and<br />start acting dry, I always cry... I cry for hours... until you text me. We always make up for it. We never get in to a big gigantic argument. We always make things better. Enough about this, I hate when we argue.<br />You care so much about me. At the times I feel terrible, you always manage to cheer me up. When I act dry, you don't start acting dry, you try to find out why I am this way and what's wrong. I love when you do that.<br />Yeah, I might hate it when you talk to your friends, but on another side, it doesn't matter to me. I'm happy when you're happy. Always remember that. Whenever somethings wrong, remember that everything is gonna be ok :).<br />You're such a good girlfriend. I can't stop thinking about you. If I'm either having fun with others or being busy with something important (like this, teehee~), you're ALWAYS on my mind. I can't wait to meet you either, it's gonna be<br />the best time I've ever had. The good memories we're gonna make, the pictures we're gonna take, the many times we will kiss... I cannot wait to do all this with you.<br />We're just meant to be. Nothing can replace you, NOTHING CAN! You will always be my love. I always drop anything I do when you text me just to reply to you. When I call you and hear you say just as little as "hey", my entire body gets<br />a big shock and I start blushing. No one has as beautiful voice as you. You always talk positive about me. You always stand up for me. You're always there to comfort me. You're here whenever I need you. When you miss me, you text me.<br />When I miss you, I text you. When you reply to my texts, my heart melts. It's just so great talking to you again, even if it's been 3 minutes since last time we texted.<br />We met in March of 2022. When you sent your first selfie, I instantly found you very sexy and hot. But, you know this: I don't give a f*ck about looks, personality is what matters. When I discovered your personality, I instantly fell<br />in love with you. You were just so caring and you always wanted to talk to me! I JUST CANT HOLD IT IN ANYMORE I LOVE YOU SOOOOOOO F*CKING MUCH AND I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU. WITHOUT YOU, I WOUDLVE BEEN NOTHING. NOTHING. NOTHING.<br />IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU, I WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD NOW. YES, DEAD. YOU MADE ME STOP MYSELF. YOU MADE ME FEEL LOVED. YOU ALWAYS CARED. YOU ALWAYS LOVED ME. YOU ALWAYS MADE ME STOP CRYING WHEN I WAS. I I I II I I I I CANT I<br />DHUASHGDUHAUOSHDGOASHDYAHSDUIYASHDIUASHDHUASHDAUHSD I CANT SAY SNAYHTING ANYMORE OMG I JUST LOVE UOI AND I WANT TO KISS YO RU RIGHJT NOW AND HOLD YOU TIGHT AND JUST SPEND TIME WITH YOU AND HAVE FUN WITH YOU AND ENJOY LIFE WITH YOU<br />AND LIVE ALONE WITH YOU AND EVERYTHINNGINIGNIGNNGINGINGINGNI!ujgb!UYG128#(!&amp;"#&amp;/!"%#&amp;!"&curren;#&amp;!"/%&amp;#)!"%&amp;#!"%#/&amp;%!"&amp;#%!"&amp;/%#/&amp;%!"&amp;#%(!"%#&amp;!"%#&amp;(%!"#%!&amp;"%#/&amp;(!"%&amp;#/(%!"&amp;/#%!"&amp;#%!"(&amp;/%#&amp;!"%#&amp;!"%&amp;#/!"%&amp;/#%!"&amp;#%!"%/&amp;#!"%"&amp;%#(&amp;!%"#%&amp;/!"<br />Sorry, I was caught a little offguard. Anyways, that's the end of Paragraph for Sage. I hope you enjoyed reading this. Especially you, Juste. Sorry if this was shorter than you expected. There's another one currently in the making ;).<br />I think this was pretty good. Except for the part when I was very... um, idk lol. But, I hope to see you again soon, reader.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love, Seth.</p>
