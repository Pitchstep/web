  Why are you here?
  What are you trying to do?
  You cannot break the system. You know that.
  What do you think you're doing?
  There isn't any secrets here you know.
  I mean, not at this moment... maybe.
  Anyways, you should go do something better.
  Play a video game or something. That's healthy.
  Wait no, that's not healthy... is it?
  Man, I don't like video games so much as I used to.
  Should probably get into developing.
